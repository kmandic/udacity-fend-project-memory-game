### Project 3: Memory Game

- This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is uploaded on GitHub as a separate repository for grading purposes.
- For this project I used vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery).

At the end of the game you will see the number of moves it took, time spent playing and stars earned.
